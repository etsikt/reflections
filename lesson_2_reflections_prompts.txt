-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It tells git to track the files in that directory.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's kind of a delivery area where I put the files that are ready to be shipped to the repository. 
I think it makes sense doing it like this. It makes it clearer what you need to do and if you find out, 
when you work on files in the working directory, that you are doing something that has
consequences for the files in the staging are, you can take them back to the working directory
and continue work on them.
